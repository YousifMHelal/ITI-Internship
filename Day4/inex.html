  <h1>What is the differences between static and dynamic websites</h1>
  <p>
    <em>static website: </em>A static website is made up of web pages created
    using HTML, CSS and Javascript (all examples of web development
    languages). Each page on a static website is stored as a single HTML file,
    which is delivered directly from the server to the web page exactly as is.
    This content essentially becomes a part of the design on your page, and
    wonâ€™t change unless the original HTML file is edited at a code level.
  </p>
  <p><em>dynamic website: <em>Built using server side language and technology, dynamic websites allow for the content of
        each page to be delivered and displayed dynamically, or on-the-fly, according to user behavior or from
        user-generated content. </p>
  <h1>What is event capturing is?</h1>
  <p><em>Event Capturing: </em>is one of two ways to do event propagation in the HTML DOM. In event capturing, an event
    propagates from the outermost element to the target element. It is the opposite of event bubbling, where events
    propagate outwards from the target to the outer elements.</p>

  <script>
    const ele = document.querySelector("h2").innerHTML;
    document.querySelector("#demo").innerHTML =
      "This is demo paragraph and " + ele;
    document.write(" <br> New heading");
    function handelClick() {
      alert(ele);
      console.log(ele);
    }

    function changeColor() {
      const arr = document.querySelectorAll("h3");
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        arr[i].style.background = "orange";
      }
    }
